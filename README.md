# Election Forecast for Bundestagswahl 2025 using Bayesian Statistics

## Data Sources
- Historical Data about election results (party shares, turnout rates)
- Polling Data: Voter preferences on the state and national level (include sample size, polling agency, date)
- Demographic Data by State and National: Population Size, Age, income, education,..
- (Party Specific Data)

## Goals
- Predict voter share for the main parties in the "Bundestagswahl 2025" on national and also state level
- The main issue is that I dont have much poll data on the state-level, for some states not even a single one (few data points should suit the bayesian approach well though, as the uncertainty is contained in the posterior distribution)

## Methodology

### Priors
- Historical Election data (and maybe some other variables like GDP?)
- Dirichlet-Priors (or are there better options?) for each state and the whole nation. Could be weighted average of past election with much higher weight on the last election.
- Dirichlet Priors are actually conjugate priors for Multinomial Likelihood ðŸ˜ƒ

### Likelihood
- Data from Polls
- Distribution: The first distribution that I would think of is the Multinomial
